# Raman mapping plotter
**A visualization tool for spectrum mapping**

This is a post-processing GUI tool for results generated by _Ramboss software_.

## Description
Data sets for **Spectrum mapping** can be obtained by motorised sample stage in x, y direction. Each spectrum contains energy (x-axis) and intensity (y-axis). For further analysis, especially spatial differences, post-processing is needed.

The user can select the energy range of a specific peak, and the result will be constructed as the *peak area* (z) for *each point* (x, y; Note: these x, y are physically real coordinates).
Finally, this array can convert the Raman (or PL (photoluminescence) mapping results.
