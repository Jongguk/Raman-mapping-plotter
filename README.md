# Raman mapping plotter
**A Visualization tool for spectrum mapping**

This is a post-processing GUI tool for the result generated by Ramboss software.

## Description
Data sets for **Spectrum mapping** can be obtained by motorised sample stage for x, y direction. Each spectrum include the energy (x-axis) and intensity (y-axis). These data allow us further analysis, especially spaitial difference.

User can choose interest area of a specific peak, then results will be constructed as the *peak area* (z) for *each point* (x, y; Note: these x, y are physically real coordinates).
Finally, this 3D-array can converts the Raman (or PL (photoluminescence) mapping results.
